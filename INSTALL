= Installation =

Please check the RELEASE notes and our website for complete build
instructions and documentation:

http://www.diva-project.org/wiki/Installation

Diva is using SCons as the build system. You need to have it installed
to build this software. For those who would like to start quick &
dirty, type:

  `scons`

to build diva. You can now run it using the `bin/diva-uninstalled.sh`
script. If you'd like to install it system-wide type:
  
  `scons install PREFIX=/usr`

Please refer to the wiki docs if in trouble.

= Packaging =

If you're a package maintainer (or you're building a package for Diva)
please take a look at the SConstruct file and the notes in the header 
(path) section of it. Try to use the latest SCons version possible.
