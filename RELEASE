= Diva 0.0.2 (http://www.diva-project.org) =

This our second ALPHA release. Please do bear in mind it contains bugs
and is not meant for general usage (yet). A lot of nasty issues from
0.0.1 were fixed, but theare are still some rough edges. In
particular, we still require patching of gst-plugins-good (dv
decoder). We understand this is a nasty solution. This situation will
be fixed in next release, where we'll be (hopefully) supporting many
more formats out-of-the box.  

This release is very much an "internal" release to catch some breath
before the major changes that will make 0.0.3 a milestone. 

Starting from this version we've got a i18n translation
infrastructure. We welcome all translators to start porting diva to
your native languages. Check the po/README for instructions/guide.
