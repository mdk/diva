Diva is a project to build an easy to use, scalable, open-source video
editing software for the Gnome desktop. Our goal is to provide users with a
complete and tightly integrated set of tools that can be used to import,
edit, enhance and export digital video material. The aim of the project is to
chart the unexplored areas of video editing for the open-source platform.
