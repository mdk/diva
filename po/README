= Notes on creating a localization (l10n) for diva =

Diva uses the standard gettext for localization. The process is very much
straight-forward and similiar to other gettext/autotools bundles. 


== Update the pot file ==

Please enter the po/ directory and run the genmessages.sh script to create an
up-to-date diva.pot file:

  `$ ./genmessages.sh`

This file is a template for your translation.


== Create a po file for your locale ==

In the po/ directory (containing the diva.pot) run msginit:

  `$ msginit`

This should create a .po file based on your `LC_ALL` environment variable.
After the .po file has been created start the translation by opening it with
your favorite editor. For example:

  `$ vi pt_BR.po`

In most cases you will want to use an editor that supports the UTF-8 character
encoding (most po files use this encoding). GEdit (the gnome default editor)
is a good choice and it provides some extra syntax highlighting for the .po
files.   


== Testing the translation ==

Before you test your translation with Diva, it is encouraged that you check the
syntax of your .po file and fix all the errors.

  `$ msgfmt --statistics <po file>`

After the syntax check you might want to test it in Diva. Start by
adding your .po file to the `SConscript` in the po/ directory. Follow the
example of other translations being already there (obviously changing the
filename).   

Recompile and run uninstalled version of diva. 

  `$ bin/diva-uninstalled.sh`

If your system locale matches the locale you're working on, you should see
the translation being used.


== Updating ==

In the future new translations will need to be added as the project grows.To
update existing translations read the instrutions above about generating the
pot file and then update the po file:

  `$ msgmerge -U <po file> diva.pot`

After running the command the new untranslated strings will be merged to the
po file.  Just edit the po file to add new translations.

This method can be automized when you append this line in the ./genmessages.sh
for your language. More instructions are given in the scriptfile.


== Finalizing ==

After you're done with the translating save the file and submit it to the
maintainers to be included in the upstream repository. Feel free to ask for an
SVN account (if you don't have one yet) so that you can easily maintain the
translation in future.
